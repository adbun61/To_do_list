# To_do_list

# First attempt at using github 

# Project is creating a to do list in the command line with python and storing the list into a basic db for recovering if you close the application down

# Update added in function for adding a description as well as add the date it was added onto the to-do list, and creating a db using sqlite3 for retaining the to-do list
